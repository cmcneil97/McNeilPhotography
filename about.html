          <p>
            Ciaran is a highly experienced IT professional with a successful

            initiatives such as upgrading the internally hosted infrastructure
            of Splunk, implementing security patching for servers, and

            In 2020, Ciaran joined TSB Bank in Edinburgh and held multiple
            roles, including IT Operations Bridge Assistant Manager and Midrange
            Assistant Manager until March 2022. In these roles, he oversaw
            various critical functions, such as ensuring that processes,

            When not working in the IT industry, I spend my spare time capturing
            the beauty of nature, the intricate details of architecture, and the
            unique character of individuals through the lens of my camera. As a
            current student at Edinburgh College studying photography, I'm
            always looking for new ways to improve my craft. I also have a dog
            named Molly that I enjoy taking pictures of because she is so cute.
            My versatile style allows me to showcase the essence and
            individuality of my subjects, and I am constantly exploring new
            creative possibilities in portrait photography. I am passionate
            about collaborating on exciting projects, capturing the essence of
            personalities and styles, and helping aspiring models realize their
            potential. Don't hesitate to reach out to me on Instagram, and let's
            create some magic together!
